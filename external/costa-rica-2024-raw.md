# Braulio Carillo National Park / La Selva Research Station 2024
This audio dataset contains 601 wav/mp3 files (600 hours) collected from five locations at Braulio Carillo National Park and La Selva Research Station, Costa Rica during July 2024. The audio was captured using Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter Micro devices. This dataset contains various species of birds, frogs, and other vocalizing taxa. In some areas of La Selva, audio was captured in publicly accessible areas and thus contains other ambient sounds such as people or vehicles.

This dataset is currently hosted on Google Drive (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zfttms73TA-HYK5DFD8o0eZpfvRn_ATe?usp=drive_link">BioAMLA-Costa-Rica-2024</a>). Here you can find multiple versions of the dataset, Colab notebooks, and the supplementary datasets also found here. The URL of this dataset is subject to change and will be posted here. The raw uncompressed audio is in wav format (44.1 KHz, 16-bit depth, mono). A compressed version is also available in mp3 format. 

## Future Work
  - Species annotations
  - Spectrogram datasets

## Known Issues
 - Wildlife Acoustics embedded GPS metadata in the wav files is not accurate. GPS coordinates in the accompanying recorder log is accurate. A script is being developed to fix this in the wav version of the dataset and will be shared here along with the updated data.
